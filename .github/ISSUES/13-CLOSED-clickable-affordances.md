**Status:** Closed
**Date:** 2025-11-25

## Summary

- Clarified clickable affordances across blog, case, and resume detail pages (interactive hover/focus states, pill-style tags with navigation).
- Improved rating UX (status messaging) and share controls to look clickable and consistent with each app theme.
- Refreshed Kris Armstrong resume layout with modern hero + download/connection cards; preserved Markdown content.
- Added tag-driven navigation on Wi-Fi Vigilante case detail pages; blog related cards now filter by tag.
- Verified lint, tests, and full builds across all workspaces.

## Evidence / PR

- Changes on branch `main` tagged in release v1.3.13.

## Next Steps (if reopened)

- Add previous/next navigation for case details.
- Add sticky share/CTA rail for long-form posts if analytics show low engagement.
