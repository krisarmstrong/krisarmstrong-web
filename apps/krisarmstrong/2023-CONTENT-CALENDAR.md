## Sample Post Excerpt

**From January 2023 (Wi-Fi 6E Maturity)**:

> "The transformation is complete. What began as an experimental technology when the FCC opened 6 GHz spectrum in April 2020 has evolved into the enterprise wireless standard of 2023. After deploying Wi-Fi 6E across dozens of organizations over the past two years, I can definitively state: 6E isn't just mature—it's become the default choice for new enterprise deployments.
>
> My 2023 deployment metrics paint a clear picture of Wi-Fi 6E's dominance:
> - Client adoption: 45% of enterprise devices now support 6 GHz (up from 15% in early 2022)
> - Performance gains: Consistent 2.5-3x throughput improvements over Wi-Fi 6-only deployments
> - Deployment scale: Average deployment size increased from 50 APs (2022) to 250+ APs (2023)"

**From October 2023 (Wi-Fi 7 Preview)**:

> "October 2023 marks an exciting inflection point in wireless networking. While Wi-Fi 6E deployments dominate enterprise networks, Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) has emerged from standards bodies with draft 3.0 nearing completion. Though commercial products remain months away—expected in early 2024—the technology's revolutionary features are now clear.
>
> Let me be clear about where we stand in October 2023:
> - Standard Status: IEEE 802.11be Draft 3.0 (near-final)
> - Ratification Expected: January 2024
> - Chipset Availability: Announcements made, samples in Q4 2023
> - Commercial Products: Q1-Q2 2024 launch window
> - Enterprise Deployments: Late 2024 earliest
> - Mass Adoption: 2025-2026
>
> We're in the preview phase—understanding capabilities, not deploying products."
