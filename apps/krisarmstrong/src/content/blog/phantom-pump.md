## The Mystery

In a large hospital, IT staff reported a mysterious device appearing and disappearing on their wireless network. Staff nicknamed it the "Phantom Pump" due to its erratic behavior.

## Investigation

Using NetAlly EtherScope nXG tools and systematic troubleshooting methods, we:

1. Captured traffic patterns during appearance windows
2. Analyzed MAC address OUI to identify manufacturer
3. Traced physical location using signal strength mapping
4. Discovered the root cause

## Resolution

The "phantom" turned out to be a medical device with faulty power management that was repeatedly rebooting and reconnecting to the network.

## Key Takeaways

- Systematic troubleshooting is essential
- Physical layer issues often manifest as network problems
- Documentation and communication are critical in healthcare environments
