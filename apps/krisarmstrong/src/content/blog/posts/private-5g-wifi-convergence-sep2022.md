## Conclusion

Private 5G represents genuine new capability for enterprise wireless networking—not hype, but not a Wi-Fi replacement either.

Organizations with large coverage areas, high mobility requirements, industrial automation, or outdoor connectivity needs should seriously evaluate private 5G. The technology works, deployments are happening, and benefits are real for appropriate use cases.

However, Wi-Fi remains the correct choice for standard enterprise connectivity: offices, schools, retail, hospitality, and general user access. The device ecosystem, cost structure, management maturity, and decades of operational experience make Wi-Fi the default enterprise wireless technology.

Forward-thinking organizations will deploy both, leveraging each technology's strengths. Wi-Fi for ubiquitous user access, private 5G for specialized applications requiring its unique capabilities.

The future of enterprise wireless isn't Wi-Fi OR private 5G—it's Wi-Fi AND private 5G, converged into comprehensive wireless strategies delivering optimal connectivity for every use case.

In 2022, private 5G transitioned from "interesting possibility" to "viable option for specific use cases." That's significant progress—and the evolution continues.
